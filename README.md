# WordUp
@twostraws Paul Hudson's WordScramble tuneup. #100DaysOfSwiftUI. 
A quite fun game to play. Create as may words as possible from one main word. 
A series of randomly generated words are provided to the user from which they can create as many words as possible. 
A top score is set and stored in file manager. Therefore, at any time, the game will remember your last high score and update it with a new highscore everytime a user gets a new highscore
